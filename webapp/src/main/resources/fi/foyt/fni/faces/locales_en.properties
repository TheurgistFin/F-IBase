about.pageTitle = About Forge & Illusion
about.title = About Forge & Illusion
about.aboutText = Forge & Illusion is an open platform built  for roleplaying and roleplayers.
about.visionTitle = Our Vision
about.visionText1 = Forge & Illusion is a place for role-playing aficionados from all around Finland. It is our ambitious intention to create an open-source online service suited to seasoned role-playing veterans and newcomers alike.
about.visionText2 = We want the community to expand beyond Finland, which is why the user interface has also been translated into English. It is possible to make further localizations and we hope that users around the world will rise to the challenge.
about.visionText3 = The platform has been developed in co-operation with Otava Folk High School. Role-playing games have been used at the school to supplement to teaching for a number of years and many of the games to first be made available in the game library have been tweaked here and there to suit the  particular needs of the institution.
about.visionText4 = Upon release, Forge & Illusion is still  a work in progress. The first version of the Illusion platform, referred to in the name, is to be released during 2014.
about.visionText5 = Here\u2019s a brief rundown of the platform as it currently is\:
about.informationTitle = Information
about.informationText = \u2018Pelilauta\u2019, a webzine focused on role-playing is integrated into the front page. Here, users can read accomplished pieces on role-playing or send their  own work for a chance to take part in the making of  the webzine.
about.forumTitle = Community participation and forum
about.forumText = Forge & Illusion has a discussion  board  where users can freely talk about anything and everything to do with role-playing. It is also a teaching aid. Many of the games available in the game library upon release are educational. We encourage both teachers and students using the games as learning aids to share their experiences with other users. This is why the forum has been integrated into the game library (see below).
about.distributionTitle = Distribution
about.distributionText1 = Forge & Illusion includes a game library, through which anyone can put out an RPG. In the early stages, publication is handled through the service provider. The licensing terms, determined by the game developer, will be set out in the library. 
about.distributionText2 = Electronic versions of games will be available free of charge in PDF format. Users may order printed copies at a price set by the license owner.
about.gameplayTitle = Gameplay
about.gameplayText1 = Illusion is a toolkit for players and game masters. Its inaugural release is scheduled for 2014.  Prospective features include
about.gameplayBullet1 = A map-making tool allowing fast sketching of maps.
about.gameplayBullet2 = Interactive character sheets
about.gameplayBullet3 = A dice simulator
about.gameplayBullet4 = Chat
about.gameplayBullet5 = Tools to help make sense of calculations, tables and other material
about.gameplayBullet6 = Game diary
about.gameplayBullet7 = Large-scale battle simulator 
about.gameplayBullet8 = Creature generator
about.gameplayText2 = Any suggestions regarding new add-ons are most welcome!
about.historyText1 = The Forge & Illusion project began in 2002, when two friends, Antti Leppä and Leevi Heinonen, came up with a plan to create a character sheet tool. Regardless of the plans made, the project never kicked off, but eventually took the form of RPG_GUI, a universal toolkit to help game masters. By 2003, the project had taken the shape of a simple  desktop application (see photo).
about.historyText2 = Even though the plan was to create a fairly versatile toolkit, capable of virtually anything, the end result was little more than a shoddily executed creature generator without (need we say it?) a character sheet creation feature, which is what the project was originally all about.
about.historyText3 = RPG_GUI was canned and in its place emerged  RgGUI, a brand spanking new online version of the toolkit.
about.historyText4 = Thus, unwittingly, the first steps toward creating Illusion were taken.
about.historyText5 = Development of RgGUI began in late 2003. The key ideas behind the project had remained the same. 
about.historyText6 = Even with the introduction of the online element, the plan of  creating a  user-friendly toolkit  designed to make gaming easier for players and game masters, instead of, say, an online role-playing game platform  remained unchanged.
about.historyText7 = Nevertheless, moving the project online opened up a world of new possibilities and prospective features, many of which have since been passed on to Illusion, such as creature models, large-scale battles and players\u2019 diaries. 
about.historyText8 = Plans for a character sheet tool never came to fruition due to time constraints.
about.historyText9 = In 2004, the team behind RgGUI came to the conclusion that the project deserved to be developed further.
about.historyText10 = However, the prototypal nature of the project had led to much of the programming being below par and the decision was made to start from scratch.
about.historyText11 = The application was completed, with enough intriguing, albeit ultimately useless features added to it to boggle the minds of even the development team. A character sheet tool was, however, nowhere to be found.
about.historyText12 = In the autumn of 2005, the team came up with an idea for a tool to aid game developers by making it possible for multiple people to work on the same game and  even share the fruits of their labour with a community of like-minded people. Core ideas from earlier projects were included in this new one. The new joint authoring tool was named Forge, while the game master\u2019s toolkit was to be called Illusion. 
about.historyText13 = Around this time, to the relief  and great merriment of users and developers alike, the graphically gifted Jari Lankinen joined the team and Forge & Illusion v0.5. saw the light of day.
about.historyText14 = This early version, however, never made it into production, as the layout was thought to be too grim and gloomy. It was not until v1.0 that the project was first introduced to the  wider world and distributed as open source.
about.historyText15 = Illusion, as well as the character sheet tool, remained in the works.
about.historyText16 = In 2010, the visuals of the website were spruced up and the layout  substantially modernised. The toolkit itself remained largely the same as before.
about.historyText17 = The post-update toolkit was named v2.0. The first working prototype of a character sheet tool was developed, but it failed to make the cut into production.
about.historyText18 = In 2013, the next major update was brought out. The visuals were given a complete overhaul and many less popular  functions were scrapped altogether.
about.historyText19 = A significant introduction was that of the game library, through which users can publish their own games, as well as freely download others\u2019 creations. As part of the update, the \u201CPelilauta\u201D webzine, with its focus on role-playing games, was integrated into the website.
about.historyText20 = The development team eagerly awaits the unveilings of both Illusion and the character sheet tool,  on the cards for 2014.
